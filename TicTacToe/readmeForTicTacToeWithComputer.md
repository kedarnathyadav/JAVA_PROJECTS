# Java Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java.

## Features

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- The game is played by two players, one being the user and the other being the computer.
- The user is Player X and the computer is Player O.
- Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all spots on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Usage

1. Run the `TicTacToeWithComputer.java` file.
2. You will be prompted to enter the row and column where you want to place your mark.
3. Enter the row and column numbers (starting from 0).
4. After your turn, the computer will take its turn.
5. The game continues until there's a winner or the board is full.

## Error Handling

- If you try to place your mark outside the grid or in a spot that's already filled, you'll see an error message and you'll be prompted to enter your move again.
- If you enter something that's not a number when prompted for the row or column, you'll see an error message and you'll be prompted to enter your move again.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the computer's strategy so it's harder to beat.
- Add a graphical user interface.
