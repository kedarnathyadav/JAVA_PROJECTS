The two files, PostServlet.java and posts.jsp, serve different purposes within the project:

PostServlet.java: This file represents a Java servlet, which is a server-side component responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses. In this project, the PostServlet.java file is used to handle requests for retrieving blog posts. It contains Java code to fetch blog posts (either from a database or a hardcoded list), format them appropriately (e.g., as JSON data), and send the response back to the client.

posts.jsp: This file is a JavaServer Pages (JSP) file, which is a technology used to create dynamic web pages with Java code embedded within HTML. In this project, the posts.jsp file is used to generate the content (i.e., the JSON data containing blog post titles) dynamically when the client requests the "/posts" endpoint. It contains Java code to fetch blog posts (similar to the PostServlet), format them, and send the response back to the client.

The reason for having both a servlet and a JSP file to handle the same functionality (fetching blog posts) is primarily for demonstration purposes and to show different ways of achieving the same outcome in a Java web application. In a real-world scenario, we would typically choose one approach based on your project requirements, preferences, and architectural considerations.

For example, if your application has a more complex structure with multiple servlets and JSP files, you might prefer using servlets to handle business logic and JSP files to generate the presentation layer. On the other hand, if your application is relatively simple and focuses more on generating dynamic content, you might choose to use JSP files exclusively.

In this project, you can choose to use either the servlet or the JSP file (or even both) based on your preference and specific requirements.
